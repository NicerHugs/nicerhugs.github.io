          My goal is to build tools that simplify our lives, so that we can give our energy to exploring what really matters. Our time is precious. Let's spend it wisely.

          <h3>Passion</h3>
          <p>
            My passion is making useful things. As far back as I can remember, I have felt driven to have a hand in the things I use.
            I developed an interest in making software when I realized that a tool I was using at work was causing more frustration than it solved,
            and I have been hooked ever since.

          <h3>Simplicity</h3>
          <p>
            I admire simplicity in all its forms.
            Technology often brings complexity to our lives, but it also affords us an opportunity to de-clutter.
            My goal is always elegant, simple solutions. I want to build tools that simplify workflow, streamline processes, and amplify creative power.

          <h3>Collaboration</h3>
          <p>
            The greatest successes are born of collaboration. I love working with others to solve problems that previously seemed insurmountable.
            The world is full of complicated problems. If you know of one you'd like to solve, I want to hear from you.

              Dance Card is a platform that connects dancers with dance organizers, finally making it easy to find dances anywhere in the country with a simple search. Dancers can find events based on location, distance, date, and type, and RSVP and keep track of events using their dance card.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dance Card is also event management software for dance organizers, simplifying the hosting process, and ensuring that dances reach their maximum potential. Organizers can manage event details easily with built in recurring event management, and keep attendees up to date about changes with automated email notifications.

              This mock-up was created as a weekend homework assignment for The Iron Yard. The repositories tab is a complete, functional recreation of my Github repositories tab, kept up to date with AJAX calls to the public Github API.
            </p>
            <p>
              The contributions tab uses creative JavaScript to compile data from an API that is not well organized for this particular presentation. The seemingly simple total number of commits presented at the bottom of the page is in fact a complicated coding triumph.
